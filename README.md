dvorak-vimrc
============

This is my dvorak .vimrc.

The basic idea is to take the movement keys (hkjl) and : and map them into their dvorak counterpart (dhtn and S). Then you just have to move everything that was shoved out of place by that move. I also added H and L for move to beginning/end of line, and disabled Q because I keep hitting it by accident.

I also have various other useful settings and commands that I use.
